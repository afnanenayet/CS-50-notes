## Introduction
- Went over syllabus stuff/introductory stuff
- Stuff is posted mostly on the website instead of Canvas

## History
- Teletypers
- Unix invented at Bell Labs

## Intro to bash
- Bash stands for *B*ourne *A*gain *Sh*ell
- Access with Terminal
- Shells (like Bash) provide an interface so the user can manipulate the 
kernel
- `control + C` is the interrupt command - use this key combo to stop a program 
in Terminal
- `control + D` signifies the end of input, sends the `EOF` character to the 
terminal

## Using bash

### Setup

#### Windows
Windows doesn't natively have bash, or a unix-like system, so you have a few 
options to mitigate:
- Install [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about)
- Use any SSH client to use Dartmouth's remote Linux servers. [PuTTy](http://www.putty.org) is a 
popular SSH client
- Install [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com) to use most of the GNU tools that will be used 
in this class

I personally recommend the first two options.

#### Linux/MacOS
Linux and MacOS are Unix-like (MacOS is actually Unix certified). They make it much 
easier to work with the class. To access bash in MacOS/Linux, just open up Terminal.

### Usage

#### Navigation
Your computer stores files in a hierarchical structure. Basically, you have files and folders, 
and you can have folders inside folders. You see this when you're using Finder or Explorer. 
This still applies to bash, except navigation is done from the very top level folder down.

The root directory in Unix is signified as `/`. All paths stem from there, so if we have 
a folder in the root directory called `some_folder`, the full "path" of that folder is 
`/some_folder`. In practice, the root directory is generally used by the system to store 
important system stuff, like `usr` and `bin`. 

For the user, there is the user's "home" directory. This directory is generally used to store 
your own files. In the shell, the shorthand for the home directory is `~`.

So, for example, if your username is `example_user`, then `~` is interpreted exactly the 
same as `/Users/example_user`. 

There are two very important commands that allow you to navigate the filesystem in the 
shell: `cd` and `ls`

##### `cd`

`cd` has a very simple usage: `cd [path of the file to navigate to]` (without the brackets)

`cd` operates relative to your directory unless specified otherwise

For example: suppose we are operating in a tree of folders that look like this:
```
~
└── one_level_in
    └── two_levels_in
        └── three_levels_in
```

We start out in the `~` directory. To get to `one_level_in`, type in `cd one_level_in`.

You can go directly to a deeper folder: `cd two_levels_in/three_levels_in`

You can access the `one_level_in` directory by typing in `cd ~/one_level_in`. Notice 
that in this case, the directory is not relative to our directory. We were in the 
`three_levels_in` directory, but we were able to jump back up because we specified that 
we want a folder relative to our home (`~`) folder. 

You can also jump back up a directory by using `..`. This is simply shorthand for the 
folder that your current folder is in. We can also refer to the current directory by 
typing `./`. If for some reason, you want to navigate to your current directory, 
you can use `cd ./`

Let us navigate back to the `three_levels_in` folder. At this point, we can access `two_levels_in` 
by typing ` cd ..`, or go directly to `one_level_in` by typing `cd ../..`

##### `ls`
It's useful to be able to see what is inside of a directory. The `ls` command can list 
the contents of a directory, and you can add options to display even more information, such as 
hidden files, or also view Unix file permissions. 

To view the contents of your current directory, type `ls`

You can view the contents of another directory by specifying the file path. To view the root 
directory, type in `ls /`. To see the home directory, use `ls ~`

If I was in my home directory, and directly wanted to see the contents of the folder 
`three_levels_in`, I could type in `ls one_level_in/two_levels_in/three_levels_in` without 
having to navigate to that directory.

##### `pwd`
`pwd` will print out the full file path of your current directory

If we are in the `three_level_in` folder, using `pwd` will produce:

`/Users/example_user/one_level_in/two_levels_in/three_levels_in`

It prints out a full file path, father than using an alias like `~`.

That path is equivalent to: `~/one_level_in/two_levels_in/three_levels_in`

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Examples

=======
>>>>>>> refs/remotes/origin/master
#### A basic example with echo
Now that you have a shell running, you can type in commands and interact with the kernel. 
A really basic command is `echo`. You can use it as such:

`echo whatever`

which will cause the shell to print:

`whatever`

There are various ways that these programs accept arguments. Echo takes an argument 
by just looking for a space after you type the name of the program, so whatever is typed in 
after `echo ` will be printed out. Other programs, such as `mail`, use flags to figure out 
what input corresponds to what parameter.

#### Example using the mail program
Let's try sending ourselves some `mail`
In your terminal, type in `mail`. This will pull up your mail, if you have any. 
You probably don't, however. 

![alt-text](https://github.com/afnanenayet/CS-50-notes/blob/master/media/mail_example/empty_mail.png?raw=true)

Let's try sending some. If you want to figure out how to use a program, you should 
generally look for some documentation. We get this with man pages (manual pages). 
To pull up the manpage for a program, the general syntax is `man program`, which brings 
up a man page for the program you pull up.

To figure out how to use mail, type in `man mail`

This will give you a quick summary of how to use the mail program. At the top, it lists 
flags for each argument, and then tells you what each flag does. It also gives a little 
summary of the program.

The manpage tells us that `mail` needs at least two parameters to send mail. The subject 
of the email is prefixed with `-s `, and after the subject, we need to include the user to 
send it to. This is not an email address we're looking for, but rather a local user in the 
Unix network, in this case, yourself.

We need to figure out what our username is. In your shell, type in `whoami`. This will return 
your username. We can also extract this with a variable. In bash, variables are denoted with a `$` 
symbol. There is a variable called USER, which is your username. In bash, this is denoted as 
`$USER`. We can see this by typing in `echo $USER` into the shell. It should return the same username. 

Now, let's send the message. We need to include a subject and the username of the recipient. I will include 
the general form of the command below:

`mail -s Here's a subject exampleuser` where exampleuser is your username.

After this, you will be able to type in the body of your message. Once you're done 
typing out your message, you want to end input, and tell the mail program that 
you're done writing. The EOF character, which signifies the end of input, will 
convey that.

After you are done with your message, hit the `Enter` key, then type `control + D`. 
This sends the message.

To view the message, type `mail`. It will show your list of messages with corresponding 
numbers. Type in the number of the message (it'll probably be 1). The program will then 
print your message.

![alt-text](https://github.com/afnanenayet/CS-50-notes/raw/master/media/mail_example/view_individual_mail.png)

You will see a `$` to the left of your cursor, this means you're still in mail, instead of 
the terminal. To exit, input `q` and hit enter.

## The bash language
The shell has it's own language. You can write programs in this language. They have the 
extension `.sh`. You can also use it directly in the shell, like you would with a Python interpreter. 
There are many references to the bash programming language on the internet. Use them and play around 
with the shell.

[Here](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/) is a nice bash tutorial.
