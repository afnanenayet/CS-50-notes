## Introduction
- Went over syllabus stuff/introductory stuff
- Stuff is posted mostly on the website instead of Canvas

## History
- Teletypers
- Unix invented at Bell Labs

## Intro to bash
- Bash stands for *B*ourne *A*gain *Sh*ell
- Access with Terminal
- Shells (like Bash) provide an interface so the user can manipulate the 
kernel
- `control + C` is the interrupt command - use this key combo to stop a program 
in Terminal
- `control + D` signifies the end of input, sends the `EOF` character to the 
terminal

## Using bash

### Setup

#### Windows
Windows doesn't natively have bash, or a unix-like system, so you have a few 
options to mitigate:
- Install [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about)
- Use any SSH client to use Dartmouth's remote Linux servers. [PuTTy](http://www.putty.org) is a 
popular SSH client
- Install [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com) to use most of the GNU tools that will be used 
in this class

I personally recommend the first two options.

#### Linux/MacOS
Linux and MacOS are Unix-like (MacOS is actually Unix certified). They make it much 
easier to work with the class. To access bash in MacOS/Linux, just open up Terminal.

### Usage

#### A basic example with echo
Now that you have a shell running, you can type in commands and interact with the kernel. 
A really basic command is `echo`. You can use it as such:

`echo whatever`

which will cause the shell to print:

`whatever`

There are various ways that these programs accept arguments. Echo takes an argument 
by just looking for a space after you type the name of the program, so whatever is typed in 
after `echo ` will be printed out. Other programs, such as `mail`, use flags to figure out 
what input corresponds to what parameter.

#### Example using the mail program
Let's try sending ourselves some `mail`
In your terminal, type in `mail`. This will pull up your mail, if you have any. 
You probably don't, however.

Let's try sending some. If you want to figure out how to use a program, you should 
generally look for some documentation. We get this with man pages (manual pages). 
To pull up the manpage for a program, the general syntax is `man program`, which brings 
up a man page for the program you pull up.

To figure out how to use mail, type in `man mail`

This will give you a quick summary of how to use the mail program. At the top, it lists 
flags for each argument, and then tells you what each flag does. It also gives a little 
summary of the program.

The manpage tells us that `mail` needs at least two parameters to send mail. The subject 
of the email is prefixed with `-s `, and after the subject, we need to include the user to 
send it to. This is not an email address we're looking for, but rather a local user in the 
Unix network, in this case, yourself.

We need to figure out what our username is. In your shell, type in `whoami`. This will return 
your username. We can also extract this with a variable. In bash, variables are denoted with a `$` 
symbol. There is a variable called USER, which is your username. In bash, this is denoted as 
`$USER`. We can see this by typing in `echo $USER` into the shell. It should return the same username. 

Now, let's send the message. We need to include a subject and the username of the recipient. I will include 
the general form of the command below:

`mail -s Here's a subject exampleuser` where exampleuser is your username.

After this, you will be able to type in the body of your message. Once you're done 
typing out your message, you want to end input, and tell the mail program that 
you're done writing. The EOF character, which signifies the end of input, will 
convey that.

After you are done with your message, hit the `Enter` key, then type `control + D`. 
This sends the message.

To view the message, type `mail`. It will show your list of messages with corresponding 
numbers. Type in the number of the message (it'll probably be 1). The program will then 
print your message.

You will see a `$` to the left of your cursor, this means you're still in mail, instead of 
the terminal. To exit, input `q` and hit enter.

## The bash language
The shell has it's own language. You can write programs in this language. They have the 
extension `.sh`. You can also use it directly in the shell, like you would with a Python interpreter. 
There are many references to the bash programming language on the internet. Use them and play around 
with the shell.
